## Introduction

This project is a Flutter-based To-Do application inspired by [this YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACpq1B_R6dw&list=PLWhSmdyhZUVSZBXZUEUNQnEPZwrhzMz_H). It allows users to create and manage tasks with persistent storage using Hive, a local NoSQL database. Additionally, it includes new features like recording task details and sending notifications when new tasks are added.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks in a to-do list.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Uses Hive to locally store data on the device.
- **Record Details**: Tracks metadata for each task, such as who created or modified it.
- **Notifications**: Sends notifications when a new task is added.
